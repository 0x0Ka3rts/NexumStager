# NexumStager
NexumStager builds a fully undetectable powershell stager for windows executables (.exe, .src, .pif, .bat, .cmd and others that you can run in the terminal).


You can choose the downloading path on the victim machine, the file name it gives it on the victim machine and of course you have to insert the link to the exe to download.

- Many features will be added very soon.

Note: Make an empty folder called "sks" in the same dir as the rest to make it work.

Note: The file touches the disk.
